Racism and regionalisme has been an issue since humans met for the first time , Black and white , northern and southern, 
and every other meaningless detail. 
We can see racism unfold before our eyes today everywhere even in our own small countr even though we are the same skin color. 
Evryone is attacking anyone with the slightest difference. 
Social media is also a huge battle ground of races , religions , regions and even language.
The more we are exposed to this the less human we feel and the more hatered toward eash other is born. 
With our mouvement we tend to remind people that we are all huamns under the skin color or the region we came from , we are all united.

 Problems : 

-Racims and regionalism are normalized due to our exposure of it on social media and everyday's life. 

-There is not enough awareness and campaigns standing againsts racism in our country. 

-People are preaching and refusing racims but still practice it on day to day basis.
